Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis wants to modernize their operations.  They are looking to use the most current effective software security.  Specifically they would like to add file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communcaitions.  Their clients include, entrepreneurs, businesses, and govt, agencies.   

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
The best thing that I am good at is making sure that the software they are using is the most recent version.  I also am able to surpress any vulnerabilites that dont pertain.  

Why is it important to code securely? 
It is imortant to code securely so that information isnt leaked.  Especially if it entails private eonfrmation and wealth.

What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It gains the trust of their clients that their assests are protected.  This allows for more cleints to roll in.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
THe most challenging part is making sure that all versions were up to date but also not conflicting one another.  

How did you increase layers of security? 
The increase in layer of security came from adding a trusted certificate using HTTPS.

In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The dependecy check report is my way of assesing vulnerabilities.  

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?
I made sure all requriements were met.  

After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran the dependency check report again.  Even after updating version of depdencies i ran the report again.  

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the rdependcy eports and their depdencies to learn more about the vulnerabilities to better understand how to fix it.  

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I may show them the trusted certificates that I am able to create.  Im 100% positive that people who own macs do not know this capability is integrated into.  Mainly using the terminal initself.
